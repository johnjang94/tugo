    <h1>Reflection</h1>
    <p>
      Looking back to this project, I think that I have learned how insurance
      companies work.<br />
      In terms of design, I have faced the following challenges:
    </p>
    <h3 class="points">Research</h3>
    <p class="details">
      Since this was a personal project, it was the major challenge to recruit
      the participants for the study. I have heavily relied on Maze or
      "usertesting.com" for the results.
    </p>
    <h3 class="points">Self-initiated</h3>
    <p class="details">
      Thankfully, I am motivated self-starter; though, it was critical that I
      was missing guidance from any advisors or executives to help me go through
      step-by-step at times.
    </p>
    <h1>For the Next Step</h1>
    <p>
      If there is anything that I wish that things were better:
      <li>
        I wish that I had a chance to learn the business structure of TuGo
        travel insurance
      </li>
    </p>
